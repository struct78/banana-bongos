# Banana Bongos

A twist on an old classic, this low cost, kid-friendly Arduino based project lets you play different instruments using fruit, some alligator clips, an Arduino, Processing, and Ableton Live (or any other MIDI-compatible software).

## Arduino Sketch
The Arduino sketch is set up for 6 notes, or pieces of fruit, which use 12 pins on an Arduino. In this case, I have used an Arduino Mega, but it should work on most Arduino boards.

## Processing Sketch
The Processing sketch is the middleware between the Arduino and Ableton Live. It receives Serial messages in JSON format which tell you what piece of fruit was touched, and the velocity with which it's touched. In this case, 'velocity' is determined by the amount of contact on the piece of fruit - the more the voltage drops, the higher the velocity.

## Ableton project
To use the Ableton set provided, you will need Ableton Live 9 Suite with the following packs.

+ [Grand Piano](https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/grand-piano/)
+ [Orchestral Brass](https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/orchestral-brass/)
+ [Orchestral Strings](https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/orchestral-strings/)
+ [Orchestral Mallets](https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/orchestral-mallets/)
+ [Session Drums Studio](https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/session-drums-studio/)
+ [The Forge](https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/forge/)

Or create your own!

## MIDI Setup
This project relies on a number of Virtual MIDI ports being setup to communicate with Ableton Live.

## Assembly instructions

#### Box

1) Using a small plastic spatula or similar, place Acrifix along the inner portions of the finger joints
2) Starting with the bottom side (long piece without the holes), insert the sides, followed by the two end pieces - don't glue the top piece!
3) Be very careful with the end piece with the hole for the USB slot - refer to the CAD diagram
4) Leave to dry under UV light or in the sun for an hour or two - it will cure completely in 24 hours.
5) Once dry, screw the standoffs to the Arduino
6) Apply some of the Loctite activator on to the bottom of the standoffs
7) Place the Arduino inside the box, so that the USB port lines up with the hole on the end.
8) Remove the Arduino and take note of where the activator marks are on the bottom piece - apply more activator to these spots
9) Wait 60 seconds and apply the Loctite superglue to the 4 areas where you applied activator
10) Glue the Arduino, double checking that the USB port is aligned properly
11) Leave to dry for 1-2 hours
